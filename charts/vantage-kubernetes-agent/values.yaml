# These limits are set low to support small clusters (<=20nodes) and should be considered minimum values for deploying an agent.
# Estimates for larger clusters are roughly:
# ~1CPU/1000node
# ~5MB/node
# These are estimates and will vary significantly based on pod density per node, label usage, cluster activity, etc.
# Agent should reach an approximate steady state after ~1hour of consistent uptime and can be tuned accordingly.
